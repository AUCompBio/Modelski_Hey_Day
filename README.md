What is Hey Day? Well, here at Auburn University, Hey Day is a student government run event that is held every year to unite the Auburn community and family here on campus. Students wear nametags, and gather together on the Campus Green to play games, make new friends, and enjoy a day of funfilled activities. The day's origins dates back to World War II, and always tend to fall in the beginning of October. With the timing this year, students will get to celebrate this day the week after strenuous midterms. So, if you see someone on campus on Hey Day, reach out! Something as simple as a "Hey!" is all it takes to make someone's day. 

Attached, you can find a script, that when run using `bash` in your terminal, will help you get in the spirit of Hey Day!
